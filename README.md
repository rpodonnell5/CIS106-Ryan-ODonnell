## Assignment 1

I wanted to take this class to learn the fundamentals of computer programming and how the systems function. Like I mentioned in the introduction discussion board, I have no prior experience with computer programming. These terms and processes are all foreign to me. However, I recognize that a mastery of computer science and programming are an extremely useful and versatile skill set that can be applied to limitless aspirations. My incentive after the Navy is to join an organization that has a vendetta/mission that I believe in which I can get motivated to work on with them. I'm exploring computer programming as one of the avenues for myself becoming an asset for one of those teams, which still allows me to be flexible on my goals.

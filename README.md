## Assignment 1

I wanted to take this class to learn the fundamentals of computer programming and how the systems function. Like I mentioned in the introduction discussion board, I have no prior experience with computer programming. These terms and processes are all foreign to me. However, I recognize that a mastery of computer science and programming are an extremely useful and versatile skill set that can be applied to limitless aspirations. My incentive after the Navy is to join an organization that has a vendetta/mission that I believe in which I can get motivated to work on with them. I'm exploring computer programming as one of the avenues for myself becoming an asset for one of those teams, which still allows me to be flexible on my goals. 

## Assignment 2

I decided to use Python as the first programming language to commit learning. After reading through everyones discussions posts and watching some Youtube video blogs about where to start for learning computer science, Python seemed the best choice for me. Its going to take me some time to master the fundamentals before I get into the more technical languages like C++. I intend on learning other languages in the future, and I felt as if Python would set me up best to give me the foundation I need to keep moving foward in learning computer science after this course. I used GDB Online and then downloaded Thonny, as recommended, to test the Hello Name program. 

## Assignment 3

This was the first time I've ever made some kind of program to input a value to get some kind of desired mathematical result. I know this is the barebones setting for a computer program, but it felt good to make something like this work. It took me way longer than I thought it would or should, but in the end I was able to make it work. Practicing and working through the error codes are important for me to better get a grasp on these applications and functions. The math part of things is easy, but putting it into the computer to make it understand what I want it to do is a real challenge for me for what I know now. I look foward to practicing these skills more to learn how to perform more intese and useful functions in the future. 

## Assignment 4

I did my best to take the lessons I learned and struggled with to improve and streamline the homework for this week. Instead of using Flowgorithm this week, I made went straight to the IDE to type out the code. It hit me during the assignment that it's really going to take me a long time until I get the hang of Python and how important it's going to be to keep practicing. It really feels like a different language. I'm looking forward to challenging myself and using the references less and less for basic code structuring. I found out through the first regrading process this week that I'm having a hard time with formatting. I'm going to do better with having my nose in the book to validate my code after I've written it so that it matches the examples we are given. Hopefully, with enough practice, these format styles will become second-nature.

## Assignment 5
This assignment opened my point-of-view of how Flowgorithm can be used to better understand the scope of the code being used. Developing different functions to be used in the same main flowchart will be helpful in sorting and organizing the code in a manageable way. At first, the formatting, per usual, was getting to me. Specifically, there was one specific line for one of the functions that I had written incorrectly. I had trouble fixing it because the two of the functions were working with no problem. All I had to do was look at the other two compared to the error to see what I did differently and fix it. I can see this being one of the go-to methods of dummy checking future functions.
